# The Great Silence

A 16-bit retro strategy game exploring the Fermi Paradox through the Great Filter hypothesis.

## 🌌 Overview

You are the **Cosmic Gardener**, an evolved civilization that has transcended expansion. Your goal: create a Great Filter that explains the Fermi Paradox - "Where is everybody?"

Select from 50 filter cards to prevent civilizations from becoming detectable while allowing them to bloom. Balance your strategy across 5 hidden truth conditions to create a valid solution.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Select Filters** - Choose from 50 cards across 5 categories
2. **Manage Entropy** - Each filter costs entropy (60 total budget)
3. **Deploy Your Filter** - Watch civilizations evolve through 6 stages
4. **Study The Report** - Learn why your strategy succeeded or failed
5. **Iterate** - Use "Begin Again" to refine your approach

## 🎯 The Hidden Truth Conditions

A valid Great Filter must satisfy 5 conditions (each needs ≥15 points):

- **SILENT** - Prevents detection (radio, megastructures)
- **UNIVERSAL** - Works on ALL life, no exceptions
- **VARIANT** - Handles diverse evolutionary paths
- **ENDURING** - Lasts billions of years
- **LOGICAL** - Follows physical laws, no magic

## 📊 Categories

### Physical (10 cards)
Fundamental cosmic constraints: gravity, radiation, stellar mechanics

### Biological (10 cards)
Evolutionary bottlenecks and biological limitations

### Societal (10 cards)
Cultural traps and civilizational dead-ends

### Predators (10 cards)
Active mechanisms that destroy or contain civilizations

### Other (10 cards)
⚠️ WARNING: Contains many red herrings that waste entropy!

## 🌍 Civilization Stages

Watch planets evolve through 6 distinct eras:

1. **MOLTEN** - Volcanic formation
2. **WATER** - Ocean worlds
3. **GREEN** - Life emergence
4. **CITIES** - Industrial civilization
5. **SATELLITES** - Space age
6. **DYSON** - Type II civilization (escape condition)

## 📚 Educational Value

**The Great Silence** teaches real Fermi Paradox concepts:

- The Great Filter hypothesis
- Rare Earth hypothesis
- Dark Forest theory
- Self-destruction scenarios
- Zoo hypothesis critique
- And 45+ other proposed solutions

Each failure explains **why** certain solutions don't actually solve the paradox, encouraging critical thinking about cosmic-scale problems.

## 🎨 Technical Features

- **16-bit pixel art** aesthetic with CRT scanline effects
- **Mobile-first** portrait design (9:16 aspect ratio)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - no frameworks needed
- **Custom pixel art** for all 50 cards
- **Contextual events** that change based on civilization stage
- **Probabilistic mechanics** - strategy matters, but luck plays a role

## 🚀 Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No build process required!

For best experience:
- Use Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
- Mobile or tablet recommended (but desktop works too)
- Portrait orientation for intended design

## 🎓 Strategy Tips

1. **Read the tips** on each card carefully
2. **Balance** your filters across all 5 conditions
3. **Beware red herrings** - not all cards are useful
4. **The "OTHER" category** contains mostly traps
5. Click the **? icon** in the entropy box for full rules
6. Check your **deployed filters** anytime (click filters count)

## 📖 Background

The Fermi Paradox, named after physicist Enrico Fermi, asks: Given the billions of stars and potentially habitable planets in our galaxy, why haven't we detected any signs of alien civilizations?

The **Great Filter** hypothesis suggests there's some extremely difficult step in the evolution from primordial soup to galaxy-spanning civilization. The question is: where is that filter, and have we already passed it?

This game explores 50 different proposed filters from scientific literature, science fiction, and philosophical speculation.

## 🎯 Win Condition

Create a filter strategy that:
- Stalls civilizations before they reach Dyson Sphere stage
- Satisfies all 5 truth conditions with ≥15 points each
- Explains why the galaxy appears silent

## 🔄 The Cycle

Each playthrough represents a different civilization attempting to escape. When they succeed, time loops and a new civilization (#XXXX) gets their turn to stop the cycle.

Your wisdom as the Cosmic Gardener grows with each iteration.
